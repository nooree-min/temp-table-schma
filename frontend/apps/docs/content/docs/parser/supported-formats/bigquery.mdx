Currently, BigQuery is supported through the tbls integration. While direct BigQuery support is not yet implemented, you can use tbls as a workaround to generate schema documentation for your BigQuery datasets.

## Using tbls with BigQuery

1. First, install tbls by following the [installation instructions](https://github.com/k1LoW/tbls?tab=readme-ov-file#install)

2. Set up Google Cloud authentication:

   - Create a service account and download the JSON key file
   - Set the environment variable: `export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/key.json"`

3. Use tbls to generate a schema.json file from your BigQuery dataset:

```bash
tbls out -t json -o schema.json "bigquery://project-id/dataset-id"
```

Replace the following with your BigQuery details:

- `project-id`: Your Google Cloud project ID
- `dataset-id`: Your BigQuery dataset ID

4. Use the generated schema.json with Liam:

```bash
npx @liam-hq/cli erd build --format=tbls --input schema.json
```

For more details about using tbls format, see the [tbls documentation](/docs/parser/supported-formats/tbls#using-tbls-json-output).

## Direct BigQuery Support

Direct BigQuery support is planned but not yet implemented. If you're interested in this feature, please follow or contribute to the discussion on [GitHub](https://github.com/liam-hq/liam/discussions/364).
