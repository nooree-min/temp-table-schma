## How to Get Started

### Public Project Setup

Want a quick setup for a public repository?
For example, if the schema file you want to explore is hosted at the following URL:

```
# A public repo's schema file
https://github.com/docusealco/docuseal/blob/master/db/schema.rb
```

You can generate an ER diagram by inserting `liambx.com/erd/p/` into the URL:

```
https://liambx.com/erd/p/github.com/docusealco/docuseal/blob/master/db/schema.rb
      ðŸ‘¾^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ðŸ‘¾
```

### Private Project Setup

For internal or private repositories, run this command to start an interactive setup:

```package-install
npx @liam-hq/cli init
```

Then follow the prompts to build a static version of your diagrams.
