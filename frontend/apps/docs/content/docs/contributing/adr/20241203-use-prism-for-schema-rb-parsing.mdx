title: 20241203 - Use Prism for schema.rb Parsing
---

## Status

- [ ] Proposed
- [x] Accepted
- [ ] Rejected
- [ ] Deprecated
- [ ] Superseded

## Context

As part of our [Node.js-based unified database schema parsing approach](https://liambx.com/docs/contributing/adr/20241206-node-js-based-unified-db-schema-parsing), Liam needs a specific parser for Ruby's `schema.rb` files. This ADR focuses on the selection of the appropriate Ruby parser that would work within our Node.js environment.

We evaluated several parser options to determine the best fit for our needs, focusing primarily on [PEG.js](https://github.com/pegjs/pegjs) and [Prism](https://github.com/ruby/prism).

## Decision

We have decided to adopt Prism as our parser for processing Ruby's `schema.rb` files.

The decision was based on a comprehensive evaluation of multiple factors:

### Parser Comparison

| Feature                 | Prism                                     | PEG.js                                    |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Parser Type             | Dedicated Ruby parser                     | General parser generator                  |
| Development             | By Shopify for Ruby                       | Community-maintained general tool         |
| Error Tolerance         | ✅ High (designed for editor integration) | ❌ Limited                                |
| Learning Curve          | ✅ Low for TypeScript developers          | ❌ Higher (requires grammar definition)   |
| TypeScript Support      | ✅ Full TypeScript definitions            | ❌ Limited                                |
| AST Traversal           | ✅ Built-in Visitor pattern               | ❌ Manual implementation needed           |
| npm Package             | ✅ Available                              | ✅ Available                              |
| Ruby-specific Features  | ✅ Native understanding of Ruby syntax    | ❌ Requires custom grammar implementation |
| Implementation Effort   | ✅ Lower (ready to use for Ruby)          | ❌ Higher (needs custom grammar)          |
| Community/Documentation | ✅ Growing, backed by Shopify             | ✅ Established                            |

### Key Adoption Factors

#### 1. Development Efficiency

- **Lower Learning Curve**: Prism doesn't require writing custom grammar definitions
- **Intuitive for TypeScript Developers**: The AST can be manipulated directly using familiar TypeScript patterns
- **Ready for Ruby**: Built specifically for parsing Ruby code, eliminating the need for custom grammar development

#### 2. Type Safety

- TypeScript definitions provided out-of-the-box
- Enhanced IDE support with autocompletion and type checking
- Reduced risk of runtime errors through compile-time type checking

#### 3. Implementation Pattern Unification

- Using AST-based parsing approach creates consistency across the project
- Visitor pattern for AST traversal promotes clean, maintainable code
- Reusable patterns can be established for various parsing needs

#### 4. Contribution Accessibility

- Lower barrier to entry for TypeScript developers to contribute
- Clear documentation and typing makes the codebase more approachable
- Potential for contribution back to the Prism ecosystem

#### 5. Marketing Opportunities

- Novel use case of Prism in Node.js environments
- Potential for conference presentations (e.g., RubyKaigi)
- Opportunity to showcase Liam's innovative approach to Ruby tooling

## Consequences

For broader implications regarding our Node.js-based parsing approach, including WASM considerations and performance concerns, see the [Node.js-Based Unified DB Schema Parsing ADR](https://liambx.com/docs/contributing/adr/20241206-node-js-based-unified-db-schema-parsing).

### Prism-Specific Consequences

#### Positive

- Faster development cycle due to lower learning curve and TypeScript integration
- Improved code quality through static typing and better IDE support
- Lower barrier to entry for TypeScript developers to contribute

#### Negative

- Limited control over the underlying parser implementation compared to a custom grammar
- Dependency on Prism's development roadmap and feature support
