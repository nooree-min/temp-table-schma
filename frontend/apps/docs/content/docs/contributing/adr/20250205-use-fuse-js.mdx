title: 20250205 - Use fuse.js
---

## Status

- [ ] Proposed
- [x] Accepted
- [ ] Rejected
- [ ] Deprecated
- [ ] Superseded

## Context

To implement the Command Palette (triggered via âŒ˜-K / Ctrl-K), there is a requirement to enable cross-searching of table names and column names within the ER diagram.

Liam ERD currently has both a web version (erd-web) and a CLI version. At least initially, we want them to operate on the same codebase. Therefore, the solution should run on the client side rather than relying on a Node.js runtime.

We considered the following technologies as the primary tools for browser-based search functionality:

1. fuse.js
2. Orama

In Pull Request [#652](https://github.com/liam-hq/liam/pull/652), we created a prototype search box using radix-ui (as used in fumadocs) and tested the speed and user experience using a benchmark project (mastodon/mastodon).

While Orama's pre-indexing offers high-speed performance, we observed that fuse.js, despite its O(n) search complexity, delivered comparable search speeds. Please refer to Pull Request [#652](https://github.com/liam-hq/liam/pull/652) for detailed performance metrics.

## Decision

We will adopt fuse.js, at least for the initial implementation.

See the positive aspects listed below for the rationale behind this decision.

## Proof of Concept (PoC) Summary

In our PoC (Pull Request [#652](https://github.com/liam-hq/liam/pull/652)), we compared **fuse.js** and **Orama** for client-side search functionality. The key findings are as follows:

> - **fuse.js** provides efficient fuzzy search capabilities out-of-the-box, without needing additional configuration for stemming or indexing.
> - **Orama** excels in search speed due to pre-built inverted indexes and offers O(1) search performance, while fuse.js operates with O(n) complexity.
> - Despite the theoretical performance differences, practical benchmarks on a project of Mastodon's scale (99 tables) revealed that both libraries deliver comparable performance, with search times ranging from 0.1ms to 1.0ms.
> - Orama's pre-indexing time was approximately 30ms-100ms, initiated upon loading the application. fuse.js does not require pre-indexing, leading to simpler integration and faster initial load times.
> - Both libraries successfully handled partial matches during live typing. However, Orama struggled with exact matches for incorrectly typed queries (e.g., "expire_at" instead of "expires_at").

Based on these observations, **fuse.js** was chosen for its ease of implementation and sufficient performance, especially for initial deployments where the data scale is moderate.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Simple configuration
- Enables easy fuzzy search
  - No need for stemming configuration

### Negative

- Search speed may become an issue when handling larger RDBMS table sizes
- Search performance might degrade when dealing with a more diverse set of searchable items
