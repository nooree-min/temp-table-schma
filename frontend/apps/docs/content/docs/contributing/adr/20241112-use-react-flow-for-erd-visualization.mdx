title: 20241112 - Use React Flow for ERD Visualization
---

## Status

- [ ] Proposed
- [x] Accepted
- [ ] Rejected
- [ ] Deprecated
- [ ] Superseded

## Context

For our Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) implementation, we needed a solution that meets the following requirements:

- Ability to render 100+ tables efficiently
- Interactive navigation features (pan, zoom)
- Programmatic focus on specific nodes
- Auto-formatting capabilities for table layouts

Two main implementation approaches were considered:

1. Using React Flow (@xyflow/react)
2. Custom implementation using Canvas API

Performance with large datasets was a primary concern, as was the ability to deliver a smooth user experience with features like panning, zooming, and automatic layout optimization.

## Decision

We have decided to adopt React Flow as our ERD visualization engine.

The decision was based on successful performance testing showing that React Flow can handle 100+ tables with acceptable rendering performance. While we initially experienced some performance issues with edge animations (using stroke-dasharray), we were able to optimize this by implementing custom animated edges using SVG elements.

React Flow also satisfies our UX requirements:

- Built-in pan and zoom functionality
- Support for programmatic node focusing
- Integration with ELK.js for automatic layout formatting

## Consequences

### Positive

- Faster development time compared to building a custom Canvas-based solution
- Built-in support for essential features like pan, zoom, and node selection
- Strong TypeScript support ensuring type safety across our implementation
- Active community and robust documentation
- Extensible architecture allowing for custom nodes and edges
- Performance optimization capabilities when needed (as demonstrated with our edge animation improvements)

### Negative

- We depend strongly on React Flow and call the API directly
  - But even if the React Flow is not optimal for us, we have decided that it is faster to rewrite everything.
- Some performance tuning was necessary for optimal results with large datasets
- Limited by React Flow's architecture and update cycle for future features

### Neutral

- Team needed to learn React Flow's API and concepts
- Integration with ELK.js for auto-layout required additional development effort, but would have been necessary regardless of the chosen solution

Our implementation has proven that React Flow, with appropriate optimizations, can efficiently handle our ERD visualization needs while providing an excellent user experience.
