title: 20241128 - Use Fumadocs for Documentation Site
---

## Status

- [ ] Proposed
- [x] Accepted
- [ ] Rejected
- [ ] Deprecated
- [ ] Superseded

## Context

The Liam project required a documentation site framework that would provide a high-quality developer and user experience while being cost-effective and maintainable by the team. We needed a solution that would:

- Support static site generation for optimal performance
- Provide robust search capabilities
- Allow for customization and extension
  - As a design-focused team, we wanted the ability to create impactful UI components for our documentation
- Offer a good developer experience for both code contributors and documentation writers

We evaluated several popular documentation frameworks to determine the best fit for our needs, focusing on [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.vercel.app/), [Nextra](https://nextra.site/), and [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/).

## Decision

We have decided to adopt Fumadocs as our documentation site framework.

The decision was based on a comprehensive evaluation of multiple factors:

### Key Adoption Factors

- **Cost Efficiency**: Fumadocs is open-source and free to use, aligning with our resource constraints
- **Design Quality**: Provides high-quality UI components with minimal code requirements
- **Functionality**: Offers comprehensive features needed for Liam documentation (full-text search, built-in components, theme switching)
- **Extensibility**: Being Next.js-based allows for extension with custom React components
- **Hosting and Operations**: Leverages our team's existing Next.js expertise for hosting and maintenance
- **Marketing Opportunity**: Potential visibility through listing on the [Fumadocs showcase](https://fumadocs.vercel.app/showcase)

### Why Other Options Were Not Selected

- **Mintlify**:

  - Prohibitively expensive pricing model
  - Usage-based billing for AI chat features beyond 250 queries with no apparent way to disable
  - Slower deployment process

- **Nextra**:
  - Lacks App Router and React Server Components support
  - Limited search capabilities (FlexSearch only)
  - Fumadocs addresses these limitations while maintaining Nextra's positive attributes

## Consequences

### Positive

- No licensing fees, reducing project costs
- Modern documentation site with excellent UX for our users
- Integration with our existing Next.js knowledge and tooling
- Flexibility to customize and extend as our documentation needs evolve
- App Router and RSC support enables better performance and development experience
- Rich built-in components accelerate documentation creation

### Negative

- Tailwind-based styling differs from Liam's [CSS Modules approach](https://liambx.com/docs/contributing/adr/20241003-use-css-modules-for-styling), creating some inconsistency
- Requires self-hosting and domain management (though this is also an advantage for control)
- As a newer framework, the community and ecosystem are smaller than more established alternatives

### Neutral

- Regular maintenance will be required to keep the documentation site updated
- The team will need to develop expertise in Fumadocs-specific features and configurations
