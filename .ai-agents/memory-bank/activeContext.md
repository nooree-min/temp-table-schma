# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on enhancing the Reviewer User experience with AI-driven analysis and suggestions integrated into the migration review process. Key areas of active development include:

1. **Schema Override Generation Pipeline**: Improving the pipeline that creates and stores schema override suggestions based on PR reviews.
2. **Schema Change Detection**: Enhancing the detection system to better identify and analyze database migrations.
3. **Review Prompt Template**: Refining the template to provide more detailed and contextual analysis.

## Recent Changes

1. **Switched AI Model from Anthropic to OpenAI**: Changed the AI model used in prompt generators from ChatAnthropic to ChatOpenAI:
   - Updated all three prompt generator files (generateDocsSuggestion, generateReview, generateSchemaOverride) to use ChatOpenAI
   - Changed the model from 'claude-3-7-sonnet-latest' to 'o3-mini-2025-01-31'
   - Created index.ts files for the generateSchemaOverride and generateDocsSuggestion directories
   - Updated the main prompts/index.ts file to export all three prompt generators
   - Updated package.json to replace @langchain/anthropic with @langchain/openai v0.5.5
   - This change standardizes the AI model usage across the application and potentially improves performance and cost-efficiency

2. **Added Reasoning Field to KnowledgeSuggestion**: Enhanced the KnowledgeSuggestion table to store the rationale behind schema override update suggestions:
   - Created a migration to add a `reasoning` TEXT field with a default empty string value
   - Updated the database.types.ts file to include the new field in the type definitions
   - Modified the KnowledgeSuggestionDetailPage.tsx component to display the reasoning field when available
   - This enhancement helps users understand the context and rationale behind schema override update suggestions, enabling more informed decisions when approving suggestions

2. **OverallReview to KnowledgeSuggestion Relationship**: Implemented a relationship between OverallReview and KnowledgeSuggestion tables:
   - Created a new intermediate table `OverallReviewKnowledgeSuggestionMapping` to link OverallReview and KnowledgeSuggestion
   - Modified `processCreateKnowledgeSuggestion.ts` to accept an optional `overallReviewId` parameter
   - Implemented `createOverallReviewMapping` function to create mappings in the OverallReviewKnowledgeSuggestionMapping table
   - Enhanced the MigrationDetailPage to fetch and display related KnowledgeSuggestions
   - Updated UI to show KnowledgeSuggestions in a dedicated section on the MigrationDetailPage
   - Implemented proper navigation using the urlgen utility for type-safe route generation
   - This allows users to track and navigate to KnowledgeSuggestions from the MigrationDetailPage

2. **Optimized KnowledgeSuggestion Creation**: Enhanced the `processCreateKnowledgeSuggestion.ts` function to avoid creating unnecessary suggestions:
   - Implemented content comparison to check if document content has changed before creating a suggestion
   - Refactored the function into smaller, focused helper functions to reduce cognitive complexity
   - Improved type safety with proper type definitions and return types
   - Optimized database queries by caching the GitHubDocFilePath query result

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Database Access Strategy**:
   - Using Supabase for database migrations and access
   - Leveraging Supabase's optimized query capabilities
   - Standardizing the data access layer
   - Handling type compatibility issues, particularly with bigint fields and nested relationships

2. **Testing Approach**:
   - Using direct testing with Supabase instead of mocking
   - Creating real records in the database for testing
   - Running actual functions with test records
   - Cleaning up test data after tests

3. **Transaction Management**:
   - Moving away from manual rollback processing
   - Planning to implement Supabase RPC for transaction management
   - Ensuring consistent approach across the application

4. **Schema File Management**:
   - Using direct path comparison instead of pattern matching
   - Providing more precise and efficient approach
   - Aligning with existing GitHubDocFilePath model

5. **Function Organization**:
   - Breaking down complex functions into smaller, focused helper functions
   - Reducing cognitive complexity by separating concerns
   - Improving maintainability and testability

## Important Patterns and Preferences

1. **Code Implementation**:
   - Use TypeScript for all components and functions
   - Use early returns for readability
   - Use CSS Modules for styling
   - Use descriptive variable and function names
   - Implement accessibility features
   - Use consts instead of functions
   - Create separate components instead of coding in page.tsx
   - Follow tsconfig.json paths settings
   - Align data fetching with component roles
   - Break down complex functions into smaller, focused helper functions

2. **Code Quality Process**:
   - Use `pnpm fmt` to format code according to project standards
   - Use `pnpm lint` to check for code quality issues and type errors
   - Run these commands before committing changes to ensure consistent code quality
   - The formatter uses Biome for JavaScript/TypeScript formatting
   - The linter checks both code style (using Biome) and type correctness (using TypeScript)

3. **Deployment Process**:
   - Use trigger.dev CLI for deploying background jobs
   - Run `npx trigger.dev deploy --dry-run` to verify deployment without applying changes
   - Run `npx trigger.dev deploy` to deploy to production
   - CI/CD pipelines use `pnpm deploy:jobs` command defined in the root package.json

3. **Component Implementation**:
   - Use named exports instead of default exports
   - Prioritize CSS Variables from @liam-hq/ui
   - Prefer UI components from @liam-hq/ui
   - Import icons from @liam-hq/ui
   - When implementing designs from Figma using the Figma MCP tool, always reference 'frontend/packages/ui/src/styles/Dark/variables.css' for colors, padding, gap, spacing, and borderRadius values
   - When specifying colors, prioritize semantic color definitions (e.g., --primary-accent, --global-foreground) and avoid using --color- prefixed variables whenever possible

4. **Database Access**:
   - Use type assertions for Supabase types
   - Handle bigint to number conversions
   - Properly type nested relationship data
   - Use optimized queries with nested joins
   - Cache query results when they'll be reused
   - Follow migration guidelines in `docs/migrationOpsContext.md` when creating database migrations
   - Adhere to schema design patterns in `docs/schemaPatterns.md` for consistent database design

5. **Function Organization**:
   - Separate business logic into dedicated function files
   - Call functions from task definitions
   - Chain tasks to form complete workflows
   - Extract reusable logic into helper functions
