- Ensure consistent Supabase type updates whenever database schema changes are made.

## Current Status

The project is currently focused on enhancing the Reviewer User experience, with AI-driven analysis and suggestions integrated into the migration review process. The initial release prioritizes the Reviewer User, with Builder User features planned for future phases.

Several key components are now using Supabase for database access, including the ProjectBranchesListPage, KnowledgeSuggestionDetailPage, and ProjectDetailPage components. These implementations use Supabase's optimized query capabilities with nested joins for efficient data retrieval, demonstrating patterns for handling complex relationships and proper error handling. The ProjectDetailPage implementation addressed a specific challenge with Supabase's array-based return format for nested relationships, providing a pattern for handling similar cases in future implementations.

The core review pipeline is now operational, connecting GitHub webhooks to AI-powered review generation and PR comment posting. This enables automatic review of database schema changes when pull requests are opened or updated.

The KnowledgeSuggestion feature has been enhanced to be more efficient and maintainable. Recent improvements include:

1. Optimizing the creation process to check if content has changed before creating a new suggestion, preventing duplicate suggestions
2. Refactoring complex functions into smaller, focused helper functions to reduce cognitive complexity
3. Improving type safety with proper type definitions and return types
4. Optimizing database queries by caching results when they'll be reused
5. Enhancing error handling with more specific error messages

These improvements align with the project's focus on code quality, maintainability, and performance. The refactoring of the `processCreateKnowledgeSuggestion.ts` file demonstrates the pattern of breaking down complex functions into smaller, focused helper functions, which can be applied to other parts of the codebase.

A new text document viewer page has been implemented at `/app/projects/[projectId]/docs/[branchOrCommit]/[...slug]` that fetches and displays raw text content from GitHub repositories. The implementation uses a single optimized Supabase query with nested joins to efficiently retrieve all necessary data.

A documentation list page has been implemented at `/app/projects/[projectId]/ref/[branchOrCommit]/docs` that displays all GitHubDocFilePath entries for a project. The page provides links to individual document pages and shows the review status of each document. This enhances the user experience by providing a centralized view of all documentation files associated with a project.

The database schema has been optimized by removing the unused Doc and DocVersion models. Document management is now fully handled through the GitHubDocFilePath model, which provides a more direct integration with GitHub repositories. This change reflects the project's shift towards tighter GitHub integration and a more streamlined approach to document handling.

A new schema override generation pipeline has been implemented that creates and stores schema override suggestions based on PR reviews. This pipeline includes a new task (`generateSchemaOverrideSuggestionTask`) that is triggered after a review is saved, a processing function (`processGenerateSchemaOverride`) that fetches data from the database and generates schema override suggestions, and integration with the existing `createKnowledgeSuggestionTask` to store the generated schema override. The implementation includes proper type handling for Supabase queries, addressing challenges with bigint fields and nested relationships. Recent enhancements include fetching and passing both the current schema override and actual schema files content to the AI prompt, allowing for more informed and contextually relevant suggestions that build upon existing schema override rather than generating from scratch. A reusable utility function has been created to fetch schema files content, which can be used in other parts of the application. The implementation also includes type-safe validation of the existing schema override using Valibot's `safeParse` function.

As part of the transition to Supabase JS, manual rollback processing has been removed from the `addProject.ts` server action. This change prepares the way for implementing more robust transaction management using Supabase RPC in the future, which will provide a more consistent approach to handling database transactions across the application.

The testing approach uses a direct testing strategy with Supabase. We create real records in the database, run the actual functions with these records, and then clean up the test data afterwards. This approach provides more realistic tests that verify the actual functions with real database interactions, leveraging Supabase's ability to be executed directly in test environments.

The schema file management has been improved by renaming the `WatchSchemaFilePattern` table to `GitHubSchemaFilePath` and changing from pattern matching to direct path comparison. This provides a more precise and efficient approach to schema file management, aligning with the existing `GitHubDocFilePath` model and providing a more consistent approach to file path handling across the application. The implementation includes a migration file that handles the table rename and data transfer, updates to all affected components to use the new table name and field names, and standardization of Supabase client usage across the codebase.

A standardized Supabase migration workflow has been documented in `docs/migrationOpsContext.md`. This document provides detailed guidance on the migration workflow, deployment system, key constraints, and SQL guidelines for creating migrations. Additionally, the `docs/schemaPatterns.md` document defines reusable patterns and rules for database schema design, ensuring consistency across the project. The Supabase migration workflow uses commands like `supabase:migration:new` and `supabase:migration:up` to manage database schema changes.

## Known Issues

- The schema change detection has been improved with direct path comparison but still needs further enhancement to better identify relevant migration files.
- The review prompt template is simple and could be improved to provide more detailed analysis.
- Continuous learning for AI components is required to improve accuracy and relevance over time.
- The coexistence with the OSS version needs to be managed carefully to ensure a sustainable business model.
- Type compatibility issues with Supabase require careful handling, particularly for bigint fields and nested relationships.
- Supabase types need to be updated whenever database schema changes are made, to maintain type safety across the application.
